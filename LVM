LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a system for managing disk storage

ðŸ”¹ Use Cases of LVM

 Flexible Partition Management
    Resize partitions (LVs) on-the-fly without rebooting.
    Allocate storage as needed instead of pre-allocating fixed sizes.

  Combining Multiple Disks
    Combine several small disks into one large logical volume.
    Useful when adding new disks to expand capacity.

  Snapshots
    Create point-in-time snapshots for backup or testing.
    Roll back to a previous state if needed.

  RAID-like Setup (with dm or mdadm)
    Combine with tools like mdadm to create RAID setups and manage them logically.

  Move Data Between Disks
    Move LVs to a different physical disk without downtime (pvmove).

  Useful in Virtualization
    Easily create and delete disk images for VMs using LVs.
